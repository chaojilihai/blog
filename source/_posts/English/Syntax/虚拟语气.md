### 虚拟语气
> + 对现在虚拟  **did/were** 
> +  对过去虚拟 **had done**
> +  对将来虚拟 **would do** 

They energetically play together (**as if they were never tired** )
 
就像他们不会累一样

My mother is arriving at 5 pm (**I would rather she came tomorrow** )

我更愿意他明天来

####  if条件句(真实条件句）

If you stay at home, I will visit you.  (**主将从现**)

对现在虚拟

|虚拟 |主句 |从句|
|-|-|-|
|对现在虚拟|did/were |would to|
|对过去虚拟|had done |would have done|
|对将来虚拟|were to do| would do|

如果你昨天认真学习的话，今天就不用抄单词了

If you had studied attentively yesterday. You would not have to write the words today.

## 虚拟三加一（特殊句）

+ **if 引导的非真实条件状语从句(一张表格3格易错点)**    
易错点:  
1.如果if从句（现在/将来）be --> were  
2.if省略，从句要部分倒装(出题人的题干)  
3.混合虚拟（if ____ yesterday,____ now）

|If |从句|主句|
|-|-|-|
|现在|一般过去式|would/should/could/might+v|
| 过去|had done |would/should/could/might+ have done |
| 将来虚拟|一般过去式/were to do/ should +v原型 |would/might/could/should+ v原型 |

例句
> Had I attended the phycholgical course,(I would have known how to attract students' attention)  (2016真题)  
+ **含蓄虚拟(第一种情况变形)**  
标志词: Without+N/But for+n/Otherwise/Or, __ 加句子虚拟  
But for the Party, (My family would have died of hunger __)我们全家15年前就饿死了_

+ 复合主从句  
as if/as though 引导的从句  
建议/命令/要求(v)引导的宾语从句 (结构:should +v 被动should be done)

+ if only (特殊和If引导用法一样)  
If only he had

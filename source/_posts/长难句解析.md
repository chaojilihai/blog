## 长难句（纸老虎）  
英语句子特点:只有一个主干谓语,可以出现其他动词但要用连词连接或变成非谓语  

+ 特殊标点(逗号，冒号，分号，破折号)  
I'm now convinced that the seceet of why French kidfs rarely whine or collapse into tantrums(---or  at least do so less than American kids---) is that they've developed the internal resources to cope with frustration. 


+ 找谓语(时态、语态、情态)  
**区别：非谓语（to do/do/dong）单独出现的时候不是谓语!**   
难点1: 动词一般过去时，和非谓语的偶去分词长得一样(v+ed 前+be 如果语序通顺就是非谓语)    
Teenagers climbed dozens of flights of stairs to deliver water amd food to elderly people trapped in powerless high-rise buildings  

  难点2:有写从属连词引导的少量状语从句，与主句的主语一直，可能从句会省略主语和助动词（频率相对比较少）  
WE convet their food ，their wine  and their confounding ability to stay slim while consuming both...but...  

  Apple's digital wallet, if widely adopted, could usher in a new era of ease and convenience.

+ 根据公式找连词(注意这里连词一定要是连接句子的)     
**并列连词:and/or/but/so/not...but  
从属连词：wh-/that/if/even if/even though/although/as/since 等等**  
The American patent system was designed to encourage creation and use of new technology.  
**难点:连词省略:宾从（第一个不缺意思成分的that）定从(指代先行词做宾语)**   
You might celebrate the freedom technology could bring to 2.5 billion in the world.  
The man (who/that) you met yestetday is my English teacher
